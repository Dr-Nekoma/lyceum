* About

This is Lyceum --- an MMO game with the server written in [[https://www.erlang.org/][Erlang]] and the client
written in [[https://ziglang.org/][Zig]] (supercharged with [[https://github.com/raysan5/raylib][raylib]] and [[https://github.com/dont-rely-on-nulls/zerl][Zerl]]).

* How to run

There are several ways to run this project, but they all leverage [[https://nixos.org/][Nix]]. We have a
single [[https://devenv.sh/][devenv]] configured, that has all the tooling required to run this project,
it also includes postgres.

** Development Shell

To enter a development shell we assume you have at least [[https://nixos.org/][Nix]] installed:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  # To enter the developmet shell
  nix develop --impure
  # To spawn postgres (for instance)
  devenv up -d
#+END_SRC

For more commands, make sure to check ~just~.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
    # Will list all commands we have right now
    just
#+END_SRC

to migrate the local dababase, you can use ~just db-up~ or ~db-up~.

*** Nix Builds

You can also build the server and related OCI images with Nix.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  nix build .#server
#+END_SRC

if you prefer running a container for the server:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  nix build .#buildImage
  docker load < ./result
  docker container run --network=host lyceum:latest
#+END_SRC

or if you want to build the ~zig~ client, run ~nix build .#client~.

** Testing the Game

To run our DEMO you need to follow the steps in this particular order:

1. ~nix develop --impure~ (to enter a development shell)
2. ~devenv up~ to launch a local ~postgres~
3. ~just db-reset~ or ~db-reset~, to initialize ~postgres~ for local development
4. Run the ~erlang~ backend in a separate shell with either:

    #+begin_src shell
      server
      # or
      just server
      # or if you want a pure build
      nix build .#server
      ./result/bin/server foreground
    #+end_src

5. Followed by running the ~zig~ client in a third shell with either:

    #+begin_src shell
      client-release
      # or
      just client-release
      # or if you prefer a pure build
      nix build .#client
      ./result/bin/lyceum-client
    #+end_src

    *Addendum*: We got [[https://github.com/Dr-Nekoma/lyceum/pull/83#issuecomment-2550476288][reports]] that (sometimes) non-NixOS users will have to rely on[[https://github.com/nix-community/nixGL][ nixGL]]. Make sure you run ~nix build .#client~ beforehand.

    #+begin_src shell
      nix run --impure github:nix-community/nixGL -- ./result/bin/lyceum-client
    #+end_src

6. Once you get the client to launch, connect to ~localhost~ and you can try
   playing with any of the local credentials [[https://github.com/Dr-Nekoma/lyceum/blob/master/server/database/main.input.sql#L3][here]].

** Deployment

This game is deployed in our [[https://github.com/Dr-Nekoma/trashcan][NixOS server]].

* Lore

At the dawn, a solitary tower rose at the very heart of creation. Its
heights soared beyond measure, each stone wrought by the hand of
Adraman. Within its lofty chambers, knights slumbered in homage to
their lord, their dreams steeped in profound reverence, each to an
ultimate idea.

With time, some knights, restless and wide awake amidst the collective
slumber, were drawn by the haunting whispers of the wind. Captivated
by the unseen melodies that danced upon the breeze, he cast himself
from the tower's precipice. As he plummeted, his trumpet echoed
through the realms, a clarion call that shattered the tranquility of
ages past.

The reverberations of the trumpet stirred the knights from their deep
repose, igniting a tumultuous awakening. With swords unsheathed and
hearts ablaze, they clashed in a thunderous symphony of war, each
seeking to claim dominance over the waking realm. Now at each strike,
the meanings of such ideas changed; losing the ideas with time.

In the aftermath of countless battles, only one knight remained
standing amidst the echoes of strife. His valor and defiance marked
him as both hero and pariah, banished to the realm of the lowly ones
where he ascended to rule over the twin cities of Tlova.

To reclaim the lost harmony and seek redemption in Adraman's eyes, the
Lyceum arose ‚Äî a monumental testament to humanity's quest to bridge the
chasm between the heavenly mind and the mortal libraries.

Now far from the tower, a new era dawns as humanity's torch flickers
into darkness, its once radiant light dimming against the encroaching
shadow of over their minds! With trepidation etched upon their faces,
barbarian tribes lay claim to the northern realms, and their conquests
marking a steady advance southward. Meanwhile, corruption festers
within the cities' beating heart, severing its ancient ties to the
source of all truth.

In the fading twilight of their former glory, the heavens whisper of
impending change, and the lands tremble beneath the weight of
uncertainty. As the cities now struggle to stem the tide of internal
decay and external aggression, the balance of power shifts perilously,
casting doubt upon the fate of civilizations wrought by the hands of
gods and men alike. It is your duty, oh great Philosopher, to mend the
meanings and bring us all closer to truth once again.
